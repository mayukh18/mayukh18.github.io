## Work Experiences

### Applied Materials
Bangalore, May 2020 - Aug 2021

I worked as a part of the CTO New Business Development research team on the development of an AI-based
 cancer diagnostic solution. Believe to have played an important part in pushing the product from ideation
 stage to production stage in a small team.
 
 Core objective was to develop object detection and semantic/instance segmentation solutions
  for cell detections with as much focus on explainable AI as possible. Tech stack involved 
  the whole grail of machine learning/deep learning e.g. tensorflow, keras, pytorch, 
  scikit-learn.
  

### SigTuple Technologies
Bangalore, Oct 2019 - Mar 2020

Worked in the Data Science team on the development of cell detection and tracking algorithms 
for automated pathology tests. Developed a new model based on YOLO which improved detection
 precision by over 30% and R2 score by 20%.

Implemented scanning algorithms for scanning slides in a robotics based scanner
 device, interfacing hardware as well as cameras for capturing slide videos.
 

### Samsung Electronics
Delhi NCR, Jul 2017 - Oct 2019

Developed multiple sub-products with complete ownership in the Enterprise
 Displays Team - like video content player, weather app, network based multi-tv
