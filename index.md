## Hi there!

I am **Mayukh Bhattacharyya**. I am a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience at companies like
Snap Inc, Samsung and Applied Materials with an experience of projects in diverse domains ranging from 
Recommender Systems, Computer Vision and recently Large Language Models. My expertise and interests lie at the 
juncture of Software Development and Machine Learning. I am passionate about building products
that people would love. The satisfaction of creating something useful keeps me going!

I am somewhat active on the ML community of **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mayukh18)**, where I tend to share my works. 
I am on Master Level in the Notebooks track and hold above 99 %ile ranks in both the Competitions and Notebooks tracks.

I wrote **[reco](https://github.com/mayukh18/reco)**, a RecSys library, in the past when there were not good enough RecSys packages.
With a Cython based core (same as what Pandas uses), it was faster than most other contemporary libraries and found some easy adoption
thanks to its Scikit-Learn style design.

I sometimes write a few articles on medium. **[This](https://towardsdatascience.com/assessing-the-impact-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown-on-our-environment-through-data-2905535da51e)**
 may be an interesting read where I analysed our environmental impacts at the onset of COVID-19.
