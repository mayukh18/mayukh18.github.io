## Hi there!

I am **Mayukh Bhattacharyya**. I am a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience at companies like
Samsung and Applied Materials. Currently I am pursuing my Master's degree at Stony Brook University - SUNY.

My expertise and interests lie at the juncture of Machine Learning and Software Development.
I have developed applications running on minimalistic Linux OS supporting display devices, complex computer 
vision-based solutions revolutionising cancer care, and more things in between. I have also developed 
multiple packages/apps on my own which have found some use in the open-source community. 
The satisfaction of creating something useful keeps me going!

I love solving machine learning problems. I am somewhat active on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mayukh18), where
 I am at Expert Level on two separate tracks and my highest rank on competitions leaderboard is 646 (out of ~170k).
 
I sometimes write a few articles on medium. [This](https://towardsdatascience.com/assessing-the-impact-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown-on-our-environment-through-data-2905535da51e)
 may be an interesting read where I analysed our environmental impacts at the onset of COVID-19.
