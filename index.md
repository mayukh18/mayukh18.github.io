## Hi there!

I am **Mayukh Bhattacharyya**. I am a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience at companies like
Snap Inc, Samsung and Applied Materials. Currently I am working at Belva AI where I am building conversational agents
for phone calls and other purposes.

My expertise and interests lie at the juncture of Machine Learning and Software Development.
I have developed applications running on minimalistic Linux OS supporting display devices, complex computer
vision-based solutions revolutionising cancer care, and more things in between. I have also developed
multiple packages/apps on my own which have found some use in the open-source community.
The satisfaction of creating something useful keeps me going!

I love machine learning. I am somewhat active on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mayukh18), where I tend to share my works. 
I am on Master Level in the Notebooks track and hold above 99 %ile ranks in both the Competitions and Notebooks tracks.

I sometimes write a few articles on medium. [This](https://towardsdatascience.com/assessing-the-impact-of-the-coronavirus-lockdown-on-our-environment-through-data-2905535da51e)
 may be an interesting read where I analysed our environmental impacts at the onset of COVID-19.
